Welcome to a new Trial & Error Video !!!


Last time we talked a little about classes, today we are going to expand this idea.

Refresher
1. Declaration: "class class_name():"
2. Constructor: "def __init__(self, var1, var2, ...):"
3. Print: "def __str__(self):"

There are multiple built-in functions in Python that you could use to help you
build and organize your class.

4. Addition: "def __add__(self):" will get called when we use the plus '+' sign
5. Multiplication: "def __mul__(self):" 
6. Less Than: "def __lt__(self):"
7. Less Than or equal: "def __le__(self):"
8. Greater Than: "def __gt__(self):"
9. Greater or Equal: "def __ge__(self):"

And much more that you could check out on the official Python Documentation.


Stay tuned for the next video on classes.
