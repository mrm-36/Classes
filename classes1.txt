1. Definition
	In object-oriented programming, a class is atemplate for creating objects, 
	providing initial values for a state, and implementation of behavior.

	When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object
	is called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the object
	are called tinstance variables.

2. Declaration
	In Python, we use "class class_name():" to declare a new class.

3. Constructor
	This is the function in the class that is automatically called when
	a new object (instance) of this class is created.

	In Python, this constructor is "def __init__(self):"

	We usually use "self" to refer to the current object, but you could use
	any name.

4. Print
	To print an instance of a class, we use the "def __str__(self):" function
	to return a string representation of the object.
